# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project (DUE DATE FOR FINAL VERSION: 12/13/24 11:59PM)

[Overview]
This project is to develop a predictive model for identifying opioid use disorder among chronic pain patients on long-term opioid therapy by incorporating diverse risk factors, grounded in the biopsychosocial model of pain. It provides a robust predictive framework and serves as a foundation for more advanced machine learning models that will incorporate a broader range of psychiatric conditions, ultimately enhancing early identification and intervention strategies for at-risk patients. For this project, I am collaborating with two psychology experts specializing in substance use disorders, including opioid use disorder.
